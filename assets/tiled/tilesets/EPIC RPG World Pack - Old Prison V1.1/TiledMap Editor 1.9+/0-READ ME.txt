When using the tile 'P. Cell 1' to draw the prison cells walls(1 width only) please, avoid drawing 
them too close to each other and avoid 'curvy' patterns like a 'ladder' of tiles.

These prison cells are meant to be drawn in a rectangular shape. The auto tile will 
cover some curvy patterns but not too curvy so most will get bad results.
Worth mentioning that when you place the 'P. Cell 1' tile, you are placing the top section of the wall.

You can watch all the examples in the video showcasing all auto tiles available in this pack
